        <div>
            <p>Welcome~ My name is Valeriya Kim, I'm a newborn software developer from New York.<br />
            I started my coding journey a few years ago when I was looking to change my career path and my partner introduced me to programming.
            I started with free online courses and tutorials and the first languages I started learning were MySQL and JAVA. I remember being fascinated with what they can do! 
            The more I learned the more excited but at the same time more anxious I was becoming, "What if I'm not smart enough to learn all this?" "What if I won't become employment-ready?"
            "There are people out there who got their degrees in computer science, how am I going to compete with them?" - I'm pretty sure anyone who doesn't have a tech background were concerned about all these things.
            Although it was very scary and unknown, I felt like I already loved it. I loved writing code and testing what it does, adding new features, spending hours looking for bugs only to realise it was right in front of me and fixing them.
            The I realise I was ready to take the next step and officially become a certified software engineer.<br />
            A year ago I decided to join a bootcamp and started looking into different programs, that's how I came across Columbia University Engineering BootCamp. 
            Though it took me another year to make up my mind and prepare myself for a big change mentally and financially, I'm very happy I did it and now I can't wait to learn more and create something cool!<br/>
            Now it almost feels like I was meant for this!</p>
